# Dark theme preview

The dark theme uses a deep blue-gray background with softened contrast to keep the interface easy on the eyes. To reproduce the preview locally:

1. Run `npm install` if dependencies are missing.
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.

These steps match the screenshot provided in the associated pull request.
